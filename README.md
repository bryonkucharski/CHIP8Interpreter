# CHIP8 Interpreter
C++ implementation of the CHIP8 virtual machine used in the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s.

## About CHIP8

## How to run
To run the program, download the project and navigate the the release folder and run the exe (windows only). The rom, font and sound photos must be in this folder. Running from the exe will run the game Wipeoff. To run other roms, the loadROM(string) file must be changed in main.cpp and recompiled. 

## How to develop
This interpreter was developed in Visual Studio 2015 using the SFML libraries. The SFML dlls need to be included in the project. Following the link will provide all the steps to compile the SFML libraries in Visual Studio
